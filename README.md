AI-assisted wound classification using MobileNetV2 for fast, automated monitoring.
# AI-Assisted Wound Monitoring

This repository contains the proof-of-concept implementation of an AI system for monitoring and classifying wounds. The model classifies images of wounds into 7 categories:

- Abrasions
- Burn
- Cut
- Diabetic_wound
- Laceration
- Pressure_ulcer
- Stab_wound

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Image Classification:** Automatically identifies the type of wound from an uploaded image.
- **MobileNetV2:** Uses a pretrained MobileNetV2 model with transfer learning for high accuracy.
- **Preprocessed Dataset:** Uses data augmentation for robust training.
- **Saved Model:** Trained model is available as `wound_model.keras` for deployment.
- **Proof-of-Concept Web Integration:** Can be integrated into a web app for remote monitoring.
